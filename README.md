# Quantum Embedding of the Knowledge

A novel approach proposed (by Knowledge & Reasoning Group at IBM Research AI, India) to embed symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), inspired by the theory of Quantum Logic. 


This work is first accepted for publication at **NeurIPS 2019 Conference** with paper details as below: 
> Dinesh Garg, Shajith Ikbal, Santosh K Srivastava, Harit Vishwakarma, Hima Karanam, L Venkata Subramaniam, "Quantum Embedding of Knowledge for Reasoning", to appear in Proc. of Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019, Vancouver, Canada, 2019.


The purpose of this repository is to open-source all material relavant to our Quantum embedding work. Details about the current set of folders are given below:
* **neurips2019** contains code, experimental setup and presentation (in PDF) of our neurips 2019 paper work.
