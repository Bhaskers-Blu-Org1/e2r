The purpose of this repository is to open-source all material relavant to our NeurIPS 2019 paper on Quantum Embedding (under Apache 2.0 License). Our NeurIPS 2019 paper is below:
> Dinesh Garg, Shajith Ikbal, Santosh K Srivastava, Harit Vishwakarma, Hima Karanam, L Venkata Subramaniam, "Quantum Embedding of Knowledge for Reasoning", to appear in Proc. of Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019, Vancouver, Canada, 2019.

Quantum embedding is a novel approach (proposed by the Knowledge & Reasoning Group at IBM Research AI, India) to embed symbolic Knowledge Base (KB). This is approach is inspired by the theory of Quantum Logic.
